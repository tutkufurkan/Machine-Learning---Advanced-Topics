## Introduction

This tutorial explores four essential advanced machine learning topics that bridge fundamental concepts with real-world applications. From understanding human language to reducing high-dimensional data, optimizing model performance, and building recommendation engines—these techniques represent the practical cutting edge of modern data science.

**What Makes This Advanced?**
- **Natural Language Processing**: Complete text preprocessing pipeline with gender classification
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA for visualization while preserving 97% variance
- **Model Selection**: K-Fold Cross-Validation and Grid Search for optimal hyperparameters
- **Recommendation Systems**: Collaborative filtering with MovieLens dataset

## Topics Covered

### 📝 Part 1: Natural Language Processing (NLP)

**Goal:** Predict gender from Twitter bio text (~68% accuracy)

**Techniques Covered:**

#### 1. Regular Expression (RE)
- **Purpose**: Remove special characters, numbers, URLs, emojis
- **Pattern**: `[^a-zA-Z]` keeps only English letters
- **Result**: Clean, standardized text

**Example:**
```python
Original: "I ❤️ coding! Check my blog: https://example.com"
After RE: "I love coding Check my blog https example com"
```

#### 2. Stop Words Removal
- **Definition**: Common words with little semantic meaning
- **Examples**: "the", "is", "and", "of", "a"
- **Impact**: Reduces noise, focuses on meaningful words

**Why Remove?**
- "the cat is on the mat" → "cat mat" (kept meaningful words)
- Reduces feature space by ~40%
- Improves classification accuracy

#### 3. Lemmatization
- **Purpose**: Convert words to base/dictionary form
- **Examples**: 
  - "running" → "run"
  - "better" → "good"
  - "coding" → "code"
- **vs Stemming**: Lemmatization produces real words (better for readability)

#### 4. Data Cleaning Pipeline
Complete automated workflow:
```
Raw Text → Regex → Lowercase → Tokenization → Stop Words → Lemmatization → Clean Text
```

#### 5. Bag of Words (BoW)
- **Converts text to numerical vectors** for machine learning
- Creates sparse matrix: documents × vocabulary
- Each cell = word frequency in document
- **Parameters**: 
  - max_features=2000 (keep top 2000 words)
  - Sparsity: ~99% (most cells are zero)

**Example:**
```
Doc1: "cat sat mat"  → [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Doc2: "dog sat mat"  → [0, 1, 1, 1, 0]
Vocab: [cat, sat, mat, dog, ...]
```

#### 6. Text Classification
- **Algorithm**: Multinomial Naive Bayes
- **Why?** Fast, effective for text, handles high dimensionality
- **Features**: Bag of Words (2000 words)
- **Output**: Gender prediction (Male/Female)

#### 7. Word Clouds
- **Visualization**: Most frequent words by gender
- **Insight**: Reveals gender-specific language patterns
- **Male bios**: Tech, sports, business terms
- **Female bios**: Design, lifestyle, creative terms

**Applications:**
- Spam detection
- Sentiment analysis
- Customer feedback classification
- Social media analysis

### 📊 Part 2: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

**Goal:** Reduce Iris dataset from 4D to 2D while keeping 97% variance

**What is PCA?**
- Unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique
- Finds directions (principal components) of maximum variance
- Projects data onto these components

**Key Concepts:**

#### Explained Variance
- **PC1**: ~73% of total variance (most important)
- **PC2**: ~23% of total variance
- **Total**: 97% variance preserved with just 2 dimensions!
- **Lost**: Only 3% information discarded

**Formula:**
```
Total Variance Explained = Σ(explained_variance_ratio)
PC1 + PC2 = 0.73 + 0.23 = 0.97 (97%)
```

#### Why Use PCA?

**Benefits:**
- **Visualization**: Can't plot 4D data, but 2D/3D is easy
- **Speed**: Fewer features → faster training
- **Overfitting**: Reduces model complexity
- **Storage**: Compressed representation

**When to Use:**
- High-dimensional data (many features)
- Correlated features (redundant information)
- Need visualization
- Training is slow

**When NOT to Use:**
- Features are already few and interpretable
- Need to understand individual feature impact
- Data is sparse (e.g., text after BoW)

#### 2D Visualization
- **3 Iris classes** clearly separated in 2D space
- Setosa (red) well-separated
- Versicolor (green) and Virginica (blue) slightly overlap
- Shows PCA preserves class structure

**Mathematical Steps:**
1. Standardize features (mean=0, std=1)
2. Compute covariance matrix
3. Calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors
4. Select top K eigenvectors (K=2)
5. Transform data: `X_new = X × W`

**Whitening:**
- Scales components to unit variance
- Makes features equally important
- Useful before some algorithms (e.g., SVM)

---

### 🎯 Part 3: Model Selection

**Goal:** Find optimal hyperparameters using systematic search

#### 1. K-Fold Cross-Validation

**Problem with Single Split:**
- Train-test split depends on random seed
- One unlucky split → misleading results
- Not reliable for model comparison

**K-Fold Solution (K=10):**
```
Fold 1: [Test][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train]
Fold 2: [Train][Test][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train]
...
Fold 10: [Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Train][Test]
```

**Process:**
1. Split data into K folds (K=10)
2. Train on K-1 folds (90% data)
3. Test on remaining fold (10% data)
4. Repeat K times, each fold is test once
5. Average results

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Every sample used for both training and testing
- ✅ Variance estimate (std of K scores)
- ✅ More reliable than single split
- ✅ No data wasted

**Results:**
- Mean accuracy across 10 folds
- Standard deviation (measures stability)
- Confidence in model performance

#### 2. Grid Search with KNN

**Problem:** How to choose K?
- K=1: Overfitting (memorizes training data)
- K=50: Underfitting (too smooth, loses patterns)
- Need optimal K!

**Grid Search Solution:**
- Try K = 1, 2, 3, ..., 50
- Use 10-fold CV for each K
- Choose K with highest average accuracy

**Process:**
```python
grid = {"n_neighbors": [1, 2, 3, ..., 50]}
GridSearchCV → Try all values → Find best
```

**Results:**
- **Best K found** (e.g., K=13)
- Plot: K vs Accuracy curve
- Shows overfitting (low K) and underfitting (high K)

**Visualization:**
- X-axis: K values
- Y-axis: Accuracy
- Red line: Optimal K
- Shows trade-off clearly

#### 3. Grid Search with Logistic Regression

**Hyperparameters to Tune:**
- **C (Regularization)**: Controls overfitting
  - Small C → Strong regularization → Simple model
  - Large C → Weak regularization → Complex model
- **Penalty**: L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge)
  - L1: Feature selection (sparse weights)
  - L2: Weight shrinkage (all features used)

**Search Space:**
```python
C: [0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]  # log scale
penalty: ['l1', 'l2']
Total combinations: 7 × 2 = 14
```

**Process:**
1. Try all 14 combinations
2. Use 10-fold CV for each
3. Find best C and penalty
4. Retrain on full data with best params
5. Evaluate on test set

**Results:**
- Best C value (e.g., C=1)
- Best penalty (e.g., L2)
- Test accuracy with optimal settings

**Why This Matters:**
- Systematic vs random tuning
- Reproducible results
- Confidence in model selection
- Essential for competitions/production

### 🎬 Part 4: Recommendation Systems

**Goal:** Recommend movies similar to "Bad Boys (1995)"

#### What are Recommendation Systems?

**Definition:** Predict user preferences and suggest relevant items

**Real-World Examples:**
- Netflix: Movie/series recommendations
- Amazon: Product suggestions
- Spotify: Music discovery
- YouTube: Video recommendations

**Two Main Approaches:**

#### Content-Based Filtering
- Recommends items **similar to what user liked**
- Uses item features (genre, actors, director)
- Example: You liked Action → Recommend Action movies

**Advantages:**
- No cold start for new users
- Explainable recommendations

**Disadvantages:**
- Limited discovery
- Requires item metadata

#### Collaborative Filtering (We Use This!)
- Recommends based on **similar users' behavior**
- "Users who liked X also liked Y"
- No item features needed!

**User-Based CF:**
- Find users similar to you
- Recommend what they liked

**Item-Based CF (Our Approach):**
- Find movies similar to target movie
- Based on rating patterns
- "People who liked Bad Boys also liked..."

#### Our Implementation

**Dataset:** MovieLens 20M
- 20 million ratings
- 27,000 movies
- Used 1M rows for speed

**Methodology:**

1. **Create User-Movie Matrix**
```
         Movie1  Movie2  Movie3  ...
User1      5      NaN      4     ...
User2      3       4      NaN    ...
User3     NaN      5       5     ...
```

2. **Calculate Correlation**
- For target movie (Bad Boys)
- Correlate with all other movies
- Based on users who rated both

**Formula:**
```
Correlation(Movie_A, Movie_B) = 
  covariance(ratings_A, ratings_B) / 
  (std(ratings_A) × std(ratings_B))
```

3. **Sort by Correlation**
- High correlation → Similar movies
- Top 10 = Best recommendations

**Results:**
- Top similar movies to "Bad Boys (1995)"
- Correlation scores (0 to 1)
- Actionable recommendations

**Why It Works:**
- User behavior is collective wisdom
- Similar rating patterns = similar movies
- No need to understand movie content

**Limitations:**
- Cold start problem (new users/movies)
- Sparsity (most users rate few movies)
- Scalability (computation heavy)

**Real-World Improvements:**
- Matrix factorization (SVD)
- Deep learning (Neural Collaborative Filtering)
- Hybrid systems (content + collaborative)

## Mathematical Foundations

### Bag of Words

**Document-Term Matrix:**
```
X[i,j] = frequency of word j in document i

Shape: (n_documents, n_vocabulary)
Example: (20000, 2000) for our Twitter dataset
```

### Principal Component Analysis

**Covariance Matrix:**
```
Σ = (1/n) × X^T X
```

**Eigenvalue Decomposition:**
```
Σ v = λ v
```
Where:
- v = Eigenvector (principal component direction)
- λ = Eigenvalue (variance in that direction)

**Projection:**
```
Z = X W
```
Where:
- X = Original data (n × d)
- W = Matrix of top k eigenvectors (d × k)
- Z = Transformed data (n × k)

**Explained Variance Ratio:**
```
Ratio_k = λ_k / Σλ_i
```

### K-Fold Cross-Validation

**Average Score:**
```
CV_Score = (1/K) × Σ Score_i
```

**Standard Error:**
```
SE = σ / √K
```
Where σ = standard deviation of K scores

### Correlation (Recommendations)

**Pearson Correlation:**
```
r(X,Y) = Σ[(xᵢ - x̄)(yᵢ - ȳ)] / √[Σ(xᵢ - x̄)² × Σ(yᵢ - ȳ)²]
```

Where:
- X, Y = Rating vectors for two movies
- x̄, ȳ = Mean ratings
- Range: -1 (opposite) to +1 (identical)

## Key Insights

### When to Use Each Technique

**NLP & Text Classification:**
- ✅ Social media analysis, sentiment detection
- ✅ Spam filtering, content moderation
- ✅ Customer feedback categorization
- ✅ Document classification
- ⚠️ Requires large labeled dataset
- ⚠️ Language-dependent (English here)

**PCA:**
- ✅ High-dimensional data (many correlated features)
- ✅ Visualization needs (2D/3D plots)
- ✅ Speed improvement (reduce features)
- ✅ Noise reduction
- ❌ When features are interpretable and few
- ❌ When all variance is important

**K-Fold CV:**
- ✅ **Always** for model evaluation
- ✅ Small to medium datasets
- ✅ Comparing different models
- ✅ Hyperparameter tuning validation
- ⚠️ Slow with very large datasets (use holdout instead)

**Grid Search:**
- ✅ Systematic hyperparameter optimization
- ✅ When compute time allows
- ✅ Reproducible model selection
- ❌ Very large parameter spaces (use RandomSearch)
- ❌ Extremely large datasets (use Bayesian optimization)

**Recommendation Systems:**
- ✅ E-commerce product suggestions
- ✅ Content platforms (movies, music, articles)
- ✅ Social networks (friend suggestions)
- ✅ When user behavior data available
- ⚠️ Cold start problem (new users/items)
- ⚠️ Requires substantial user-item interactions

### Best Practices

**NLP:**
- Always clean text (regex, lowercase)
- Remove stop words (improves signal-to-noise)
- Lemmatize > Stem (produces real words)
- Try TF-IDF instead of BoW for better results
- Visualize with word clouds for insights

**PCA:**
- **Must** standardize features first (mean=0, std=1)
- Check cumulative explained variance
- Use scree plot or elbow method to choose k
- Whitening can improve downstream algorithms
- Don't use PCA on sparse data (text after BoW)

**Model Selection:**
- Always use cross-validation (never trust single split)
- k=10 is good default for CV
- Stratify for classification (maintains class balance)
- Normalize features before KNN/SVM/LogReg
- Grid Search: start coarse, then refine

**Recommendations:**
- More data = better recommendations
- Handle missing values (most users don't rate most movies)
- Consider hybrid approaches (collaborative + content)
- Cold start: use content-based for new items
- Sparsity is the biggest challenge

### Common Pitfalls

❌ **Forgetting to Clean Text**
- Raw tweets have noise (URLs, emojis, special chars)
- Cleaning can improve accuracy by 10-20%

❌ **Not Standardizing Before PCA**
- Features with large scales dominate PCA
- Always use StandardScaler first!

❌ **Using Test Data in CV**
- Cross-validation should only use training set
- Test set is final evaluation only

❌ **Overfitting in Grid Search**
- Too many parameters → finding noise
- Use nested CV for unbiased estimate

❌ **Ignoring Sparsity in Recommendations**
- Most users rate <1% of movies
- Need techniques to handle missing data

❌ **Choosing K Randomly in KNN**
- K matters! (K=1 overfits, K=100 underfits)
- Always tune with cross-validation
